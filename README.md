 - Microprinter.rb - a ruby class to communicate with the arduino  
 - Microprinter_debug.rb - ruby class which prints to console rather than printer

TODO
----

In no particular order, some things to be done:

-   check RSS feeds and print new items as they appear  
    Examples: twitter, latest links on pinboard.in, latest instapaper itemsâ€¦
-   make URL for weather reports configurable so it's not hard coded to south of england (!)
-   create a config file for arduino port, RSS feeds, weather location
-   re-integrate debug library into microprinter.rb - pipe serial messages to console for debugging and automated testing. 
-   format the RSS feed item printout to shorten the URL and print properly so that it can be OCR'd with Google Goggles
-   possibly port Ben O'Steen's image stuff so that you can print QRCodes on links, as well as images.
